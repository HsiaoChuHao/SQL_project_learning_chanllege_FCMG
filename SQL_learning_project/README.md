## P&L Statement Data and Metrics preparation introduction

**1. creste SQL user define function for get fiscal year**
   
```mysql 
CREATE DEFINER=`root`@`localhost` FUNCTION `get_fiscal_year`(calendar_date DATE) RETURNS int
    DETERMINISTIC
BEGIN
	DECLARE fiscal_year INT;
    SET fiscal_year = YEAR(DATE_ADD(calendar_date, INTERVAL 4 MONTH));
    RETURN fiscal_year;
END;
```

**2. To calculate gross price and total gross price 
by using fact_sales_monthly combined fact_gross_price and dim_product**

```mysql
SELECT 
s.date, s.product_code, 
p.product, p.variant, s.sold_quantity,g.fiscal_year, g.gross_price,
ROUND(g.gross_price*s.sold_quantity,2) AS gross_price_total
FROM fact_sales_monthly s

WHERE 
	customer_code = 90002002 AND 
	get_fiscal_year(date) = 2021   
ORDER BY date ASC;
```

## Supply chain Data and Metrics preparation introduction

**1.create table fact_act_est by outer join from fact_sales_monthly and fact_forecast_monthly and update null to 0**

```sql
drop table if exists fact_act_est;
create table fact_act_est 
(
select 
	s.date as date, 
    s.fiscal_year as fiscal_year, 
    s. product_code  as product_code,
    s.customer_code as customer_code,
    s.sold_quantity as sold_quantity,
	f. forecast_quantity as forecast_quantity
FROM fact_sales_monthly s
LEFT JOIN fact_forecast_monthly f
USING (date,customer_code,product_code)
UNION
select 
	f.date as date,
    f.fiscal_year as fiscal_year,
    f. product_code as  product_code,
    f.customer_code as customer_code,
    s.sold_quantity as sold_quantity,
	f. forecast_quantity as forecast_quantity
FROM  fact_forecast_monthly f 
LEFT JOIN fact_sales_monthly s
USING (date,customer_code,product_code));
```
```sql
update fact_act_est
set sold_quantity = 0
where  sold_quantity is null;
```
```sql
update fact_act_est
set forecast_quantity = 0

**2. create the trigger to automatically insert record in fact_act_est table whenever insertion happens in fact_sales_monthly and fact_forecast_monthly**

```sql
CREATE DEFINER=`root`@`localhost` TRIGGER `fact_sales_monthly_AFTER_INSERT` AFTER INSERT ON `fact_sales_monthly` FOR EACH ROW BEGIN
	insert into fact_act_est
		(date, product_code, customer_code, sold_quantity)
    values(
		NEW.date, 
        NEW.product_code,
        NEW.customer_code,
        NEW.sold_quantity)
    on duplicate key update
		sold_quantity = values(sold_quantity);
END;

CREATE DEFINER=`root`@`localhost` TRIGGER `fact_forecast_monthly_AFTER_INSERT` AFTER INSERT ON `fact_forecast_monthly` FOR EACH ROW BEGIN
	insert into fact_act_est
		(date, product_code, customer_code, forecast_quantity)
    values(
		NEW.date, 
        NEW.product_code, 
        NEW.customer_code, 
        NEW.forecast_quantity
	)
    on duplicate key update
		forecast_quantity = values(forecast_quantity);
END;
```

**3. calulate the net_error, net_error%, abs_error, abs_error%, forecast_accuracy**
**(Create in stored procedures for convenient use)**

```sql
with ctef AS(
	select 
		*,
		sum(forecast_quantity-sold_quantity) AS net_err,
		(sum(forecast_quantity-sold_quantity))/sum(forecast_quantity)*100 AS net_err_pct,
		sum(abs(forecast_quantity-sold_quantity)) AS abs_err,
		sum(abs(forecast_quantity-sold_quantity))/sum(forecast_quantity)*100 AS abs_err_pct
	from fact_act_est f
	where fiscal_year = 2021
	group by customer_code)
select 
	e.customer_code, c.customer, c.market, 
    sum(e.sold_quantity) AS total_sold_qty,
    sum(e.forecast_quantity) AS total_forecast_qty,
    e. net_err, e.net_err_pct, e.abs_err, e.abs_err_pct,
	round(IF(abs_err_pct>100,0,100.0-abs_err_pct),1) AS forecast_accuracy
from ctef e
join dim_customer c
USING (customer_code)
group by customer_code
order by forecast_accuracy desc;
